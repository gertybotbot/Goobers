// mergeDemotedLabel marks a crowned lander that repeatedly could not merge at
// the same head, so the election stops re-crowning it and its blocked cluster
// can drain AROUND it instead of deadlocking behind it (#950). The election is
// a pure function of {PR number, blockers}, so a FIFO-minimum lander that can
// never merge (red CI it recovers-then-loses, a base advance that keeps
// intersecting its files, an unresolvable conflict) is re-elected identically
// every cycle while every sibling parks blocked-on-sibling behind it — zero
// forward progress until a human intervenes. Demotion breaks that: after a
// bounded number of merge refusals at an unchanged head, the lander is excluded
// from election and its predecessors-liveness, so the next-lowest cluster
// member is crowned instead.
//
// Unlike goobers:merge-escalated (a human-only bucket, CLAUDE.md standing
// rule), demotion SELF-HEALS: the moment the PR's head advances past the
// recorded snapshot (a remediation push, a rebase — a genuinely new attempt),
// the demotion lifts and the PR is eligible to win its own election again. The
// demoted PR still goes through pr-remediation on its own merits; demotion is
// about unblocking its siblings, not abandoning it.

// stage posts and the election read-sites consult — the merge-side analog of

// (applyverdict.go). It lives in a sticky PR comment so it survives across
// merge-review cycles without inventing a second source of truth about which
// PR is demoted (the same discipline #716/#748 use).

	// advancing — ever accumulates toward the demotion threshold.
