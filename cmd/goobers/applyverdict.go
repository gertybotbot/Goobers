// WHAT ELECTION MEANS. Being elected does not mean "merge this regardless of
// review". It means "stop counting those siblings as blockers." And once that
// is said out loud, the verdict follows deterministically rather than by fiat:
// every finding was a pure ordering ask (allCrossPRBlocked — the PR is
// individually fine and merely waiting its turn), and this PR is the one whose
// turn it is. There is no defect left to fix, so there is nothing for
// `needs-changes` to describe. The decision is derived, not overridden. The
// same reasoning now also covers a PR whose reviewer verdict is ALREADY a
// genuine pass (resolveElectionOutcome below): sharing a deterministic
// overlap with a live sibling means it is not automatically its cluster's
// lander either, and #1071 requires that to be resolved before it reaches
// merge-pr, exactly like the needs-changes case.
//
// WHY NOT THE PREVIOUS SHAPE. elect-gate's pass branch used to route straight
// to merge-pr, deliberately bypassing this stage — which produced three
// problems at once:
//
//  1. merge-pr builds its commit message from a `pass` verdict comment pinned
//     to the current head/base SHA (structuredMergeCommitMessage, mergepr.go).
//     The bypass means no verdict comment is ever posted on this path and the
//     verdict was needs-changes anyway, so that lookup finds nothing and
//     merge-pr exits 1 — a hard stage failure, every cycle, for as long as the
//     cluster exists. The elected path could not actually merge anything.
//  2. merge-pr's "was this reviewed favorably" conjunct compares against the
//     workflow's hardcoded `verdict: "pass"` input rather than the real
//     verdict, so on this path the safety check was satisfied by a constant
//     string.
//  3. An about-to-merge PR published no verdict at all, so nothing recorded
//     why it merged.
//
// Deriving the pass here fixes all three by construction: the ordinary
// apply-verdict -> published-verdict -> merge-pr path now carries a real,
// SHA-pinned pass verdict comment, and no separate merge authority exists.
// It also costs no extra cycle — the PR still merges on this pass.
//
// Requiring an independent `pass` verdict instead would deadlock the exact
// situation election exists to break: mutually-blocked PRs cannot each earn a
// pass while each is waiting on the other.
//
// The findings are deliberately left intact on the published verdict. The
// ordering asks were real observations and stay visible; only the decision they
// rolled up to changes, and the rationale states exactly why.

// resolveElectionOutcome resolves single-lander election for a sibling-
// overlap PR (#1071/PRL-021), regardless of whether the reviewer's raw
// decision was needs-changes (electedLanderPass's original case, an
// all-ordering verdict resolved into a derived pass) or already a genuine
// pass (a reviewer verdict with no defect of its own). Either way, once a PR
// shares a deterministic file overlap with a live sibling, it must not reach
// merge-pr as a landing authority until this same election crowns it —
// otherwise two overlap-cluster members could each independently earn a
// clean pass and race GitHub's native merge queue with no arbitration at
// all, exactly the bypass #1071 exists to close.
//
// Returns rationale == "" whenever nothing needs to change: no overlap, a
// non-electable decision (fail, or an already-escalated verdict), or an
// ordinary parked needs-changes member (unrelated to this PR — the existing
// blocked-on-sibling routing already handles it via effective.Findings/

// mootFailReason reports whether a `fail`-verdicted pull request is MOOT —

//
// The distinction matters because it decides who has to act. `fail` normally
// means the reviewer judged the APPROACH wrong, which is a genuine judgment
// call reserved for a human (design doc §4 D2), and auto-closing those would
// take a person out of the one loop they were deliberately left in. But a
// meaningful share of `fail` verdicts are not that at all: the work was already
// obsolete before the run started, and there is nothing for anyone to decide.
//
// PR #919 (weekend_10, 2026-07-19) is the worked example. #827 merged the real
// torn-read fix at 2026-07-18T10:57Z; issue #684 was closed as superseded at
// 02:52Z; the implementation run opened #919 for #684 at 03:34Z, 42 minutes
// AFTER its issue was closed. The reviewer's rationale said outright "close PR
// #919 rather than merging it" — and had no mechanism to do so, so it sat open
// until a human closed it by hand. (#947 tracks preventing the wasted run in
// the first place; this only stops the debris needing a human.)
//
// Mootness is established ONLY by a deterministic fact about the repository,
// never by the reviewer's prose. The verdict being `fail` is what makes the
// question worth asking; it is not itself evidence of the answer. A model can
// be wrong about whether something is superseded, and closing a pull request on
// a wrong belief is not a failure mode worth accepting to save a click — so the
// model's rationale gates nothing here, it is merely quoted in the comment.
