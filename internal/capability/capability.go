// Package capability is the canonical registry of capability strings a Goober
// stage or a dedicated runner component may hold (ARCHITECTURE.md §5,
// SEC-042/SEC-044). It is the single source of truth the DSL compiler
// validates declarations against (internal/workflow), and that other
// capability-scoped seams — the credential injector (internal/credentials),
// the telemetry query gate (internal/telemetry/query) — name their own
// constants from, so a typo'd or invented capability string is caught at
// compile/validate time rather than silently accepted until admission, or
// never caught at all (issue #74: `github:pr:write` vs. an issue-text typo of
// `github:prs:write` slipping through unnoticed because nothing checked either
// spelling against a ground truth).
//
// This package has no dependencies beyond the stdlib, so every layer that
// needs to name a capability — including packages that deliberately avoid
// importing api/v1alpha1 or internal/journal to stay decoupled from the wire
// contract or the runner (internal/telemetry/query's own doc comment) — can
// depend on it without pulling in anything heavier.
package capability

// Capability identifies a scoped grant a stage or dedicated runner component
// may hold. The dotted "resource:verb" shape mirrors provider/credential
// capability strings already in use (ARCHITECTURE.md §5).
type Capability string

// The canonical V0 capability set. Add new entries here first; the compiler
// rejects anything not listed (WithGoobers-gated admission,
// internal/workflow/compile.go), so a definition can never drift ahead of this
// registry. Runner-only entries must also be excluded by StageDeclarable.
