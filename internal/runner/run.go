// stage and checked out as-is, carrying prior stages' commits, by every stage
// after it (internal/worktree.Manager.Create's own doc comment, #133). That
// shared branch, not a shared directory, is what makes local-ci and the
// reviewer gate evaluate the run's actual diff.
//
// A workflow that re-enters on work that ALREADY has a branch needs that same
// continuity mechanism pointed somewhere else. pr-remediation is the case this
// exists for (docs/design/v0/pr-lifecycle-loop.md §5): it rebases and reworks
// an EXISTING PR, so its implement/review/local-ci stages must operate on the
// PR's own head branch, not a fresh one cut from main. Its gather-pr-context
// entrypoint emits the selected PR's head branch under this key, and every
// stage from there on — including agentic stages and gate evaluators, which
// have no way to re-checkout anything for themselves — is provisioned against
// it with no per-stage cooperation at all.
//
// The rebinding is sticky for the remainder of the run and survives a crash:
// stage outputs are journaled on stage.finished, so Resume recovers the most
// recent binding (lastWorkspaceBranch) into walkSeed rather than silently
// reverting a resumed run to the default branch mid-chain.
//
// A rebound branch must already exist (worktree.CreateOptions.RequireExistingBranch
// below turns a missing one into a loud failure rather than a silent empty branch
// cut from base), and must live in the run-branch namespace the worktree manager
// protects from its prune-fetch (internal/worktree/manager.go's
// runBranchNamespace) — otherwise the next stage's WorkingCopy refresh would
// delete it. Emitting an empty value is a no-op, not a reset.
//
// ONLY A DETERMINISTIC STAGE MAY REBIND. An agentic stage's Outputs are
// authored by the model itself (internal/harness's result-shape hint invites a
// free-form `"outputs": {...}` map and internal/harness.Executor passes it
// through verbatim), so honoring this key from one would let any goober, in any
// workflow, silently move every subsequent stage — including `push-branch` —
// onto a branch of its choosing. `implementation` needs no diff at all to be

// runTask dispatches one task, retrying dispatch-level failures up to its
// declared policy: provisions a fresh worktree per attempt, invokes the
// matching invoke.Deterministic/invoke.Goober executor (which resolves its own
// capability-scoped credentials and commits its own artifacts to the run
// journal — see executor.go's ArtifactRecorder doc), and journals every
// attempt distinctly, never overwriting history (§5). Per the Temporal
// engine's established semantics, a SUCCESSFUL attempt's task always flows to
// Next regardless of its business ResultStatus — a downstream gate is what
// branches on that; only a genuine dispatch error (the executor returning a
// Go error — infra failure, not a business "failure" status) triggers a
// retry. Dispatch errors marked by invoke.InfrastructureFailure use the
// runner's bounded infrastructure allowance and journal their retry as
// infrastructure; other dispatch retries use Task.Retry and are policy
// attempts.
//
// Dispatch ignores ordinary run-level cancellation (SIGTERM), so the current
// attempt can finish and journal cleanly; only a stalled-run watchdog request
// cancels it mid-dispatch. walk checks ordinary cancellation between stages.
//
// startAttempt is normally 1; a resume past an interrupted attempt (resume.go)
// passes the next attempt number instead, so the attempts a crash already
// consumed still count against the task's own MaxAttempts budget — a crash
// must never grant a task more attempts than its declared policy allows.
//
// upstreamResult is the immediately preceding stage's ResultEnvelope (the
// zero value for the run's first task) — dispatchTask threads its Outputs
// into this task's Inputs per t.InputsFrom (#132), the task-to-task analog
// of evaluateGate's unconditional Outputs flatten.

// mutations is the same kind of additive, non-overriding signal (issue
// #228): a deterministic stage's underlying subcommand (backlog-query/
// open-pr/issue-close-out) runs as a separate short-lived process with no
// legal journal access, so it records its provider-mutation facts to a
// sidecar file in the workspace instead; dispatchTask reads that sidecar
// (before cleanup destroys the workspace, since runTask can't read
// it after the fact) and returns the parsed facts for runTask to project
// into ref.touched events. Read on the deterministic success path only —
// mutations only ever come from a deterministic provider-chain subcommand,
// never an agentic stage.
//
// After buildEnvelope, t.InputsFrom is applied on top of the static declared
// Inputs: for each inputKey/outputKey pair, upstreamResult.Outputs[outputKey]
// overlays env.Inputs[inputKey] (#132) — a declared outputKey missing from
// upstreamResult.Outputs fails the stage closed, since InputsFrom is a
// contract, not a hint (unlike evaluateGate's unconditional Outputs flatten,
// which is safe precisely because a gate never mutates run state on a wide-
// open read).
