// TestPhaseFromEventsTreatsTerminalGatesAsTerminal is the regression guard for
// the stranded-claim incident: a gate that resolves to a reserved TERMINAL
// target ends the run, and the gate.evaluated event is the terminal record.
// Treating only run.finished as terminal reported such runs PhaseRunning
// forever, and claimHolderTerminal derives claim recovery from exactly that
// phase — so every PR an aborted run held stayed claimed for its full lease.
//
// The "@join" and named-target cases are the discriminating half: a branch
// target and an ordinary gate transition must NOT terminalize a live run, or
// every parallel workflow would report terminal mid-flight and release claims
// it still needs.
